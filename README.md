# STAT628-module2
## Goals and Motivation
This project trys to build a simple model to estimate male body fat as accurately as possible based on a real data set of 252 men with their 
body fat percentage and 16 body measurements.
## Data
The fold [data](https://github.com/rzhao-99/STAT628-module2/tree/main/data) contains the raw dataset and the cleaned version.
## Code
The fold [code](https://github.com/rzhao-99/STAT628-module2/tree/main/code) contains all the code for our analysis from start to finish.  
[Module2.Rmd](https://github.com/rzhao-99/STAT628-module2/blob/main/code/module2.Rmd) is the main part of the code. [Module2.pdf](https://github.com/rzhao-99/STAT628-module2/blob/main/code/module2.pdf) is the outcome of Module2.Rmd. One can inspect the outcome of the code in Module2.Rmd.  
[Bodyfat_app.R](https://github.com/rzhao-99/STAT628-module2/blob/main/code/Bodyfat_app.R) hosts the shiny app by which can provide the predictions of bodyfat given certain body measurements. You can also visit the app via [this link](https://stat628module2group14.shinyapps.io/module2/).
